## One-line idea
Point estimation uses a single number from sample data to estimate an unknown population parameter.

---

## What point estimation means

A point estimate is:

- one numerical value  
- used to approximate a population parameter  

It does not express uncertainty.

---

## Examples

| Parameter | Point Estimator |
|--------|----------------|
| Population mean (μ) | Sample mean (x̄) |
| Population variance (σ²) | Sample variance (s²) |
| Population proportion (p) | Sample proportion (p̂) |

## Key property

A point estimate is:

- simple  
- easy to compute  
- incomplete by itself  

It gives **no measure of reliability**.

---

## Why point estimation is limited

Two samples can produce:

- different point estimates  

Without uncertainty information, we cannot judge which is better.

---

## Role in inference

Point estimation is:

- the first step in inference  
- the center of confidence intervals  
- the input to hypothesis tests  

Uncertainty is added later.

## In short

> Point estimation tells us *what the estimate is*, not *how good it is*.
