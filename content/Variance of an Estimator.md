## One-line idea
The variance of an estimator measures how much its value changes from sample to sample.

---

## Why variance matters

Two estimators may both be unbiased, but:

- one may fluctuate wildly  
- the other may be stable  

Variance captures this instability.

---

## What estimator variance represents

Estimator variance measures:

- sensitivity to random sampling  
- spread of the sampling distribution  
- reliability of the estimate  

Lower variance means more precision.

## Conceptual view
True parameter  
↓  
Estimator values across samples  
↓  
Spread = variance

---

## Important insight

Variance is caused by:

- population variability  
- sample size  
- estimation method  

It is not an error — it is uncertainty.

---

## Effect of sample size

As sample size increases:

- estimator variance decreases  
- estimates become more stable  

This follows the 1 / n relationship.

---

## Why variance matters in inference

Variance determines:

- standard error  
- width of confidence intervals  
- statistical power  

Inference quality depends heavily on estimator variance.

## In short

> Variance measures how noisy an estimator is across samples.
