## Understanding
- A *Lexeme* is a unit of language whose identity is shared among various words.
	- **Example** : Dance  (lexeme) -> Dancing, Dance ( These words belong to a family name called Dance)
- Adding suffix changes the grammatical sense of the word but doesn't change the core concept of what Lexeme represents.
- Understanding the Lexemes of the words shrinks the Vocabulary size we are dealing with. Making the math more efficient and doable.
