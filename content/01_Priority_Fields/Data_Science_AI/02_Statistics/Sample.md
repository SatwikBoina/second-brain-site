## Definiton :
- A subset of the entire group of our interest (*Population*) is called a Sample.
- Ideally, We want the sample to be representative of the Population.
- It's the empirical distribution of the data available.
- Using a sample, We like to infer more about the population.
**Note :**
The process of drawing a sample out of the Population is called *Sampling*.

To treat a **Sample** as a valid proxy for the **Population**, the following must hold:

1. **Randomness:** Every member of the [[Sampling Frame]] must have a known (usually equal) probability of selection.
2. **Representativeness:** The sampling frame must align closely with the target population.
3. **Independence:** One observation should not influence another (in simple random sampling).
