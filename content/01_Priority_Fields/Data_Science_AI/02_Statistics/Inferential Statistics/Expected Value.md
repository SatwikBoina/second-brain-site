## One-line idea
The expected value is the long-run average outcome of a random process.

---

## Why expected value exists

Random outcomes vary every time.

But when a process is repeated many times, results stabilize around a central value.

Expected value represents that stable center.

---

## What it represents

Expected value is:

- not a guaranteed outcome  
- not necessarily a value that occurs  
- the average result over many repetitions  

It describes where randomness **settles in the long run**.

## Example

Toss a fair coin:

- Head = 1  
- Tail = 0  

Individual outcomes vary, but over many tosses:

- average → 0.5  

That value is the expected value.

---

## Why it matters in inference

Expected value:

- defines population parameters (μ)  
- is what estimators try to recover  
- connects probability to statistics  

Sample means attempt to estimate the expected value.

---

## Important insight

The expected value describes the **distribution**, not a single observation.

One outcome can differ greatly from expectation.

---

## In short

> Expected value is where uncertainty balances out in the long run.
