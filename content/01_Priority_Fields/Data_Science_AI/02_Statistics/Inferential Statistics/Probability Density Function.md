# Probability Density Function (PDF)

## 1. What it represents
The PDF describes how dense probability is around different values of a continuous random variable.

It does not give probability directly.

---

## 2. How probability is defined
Probability is obtained from **area under the curve**:

$P(a \leq X \leq b) = \text{area between a and b}$

Probability at a single point is zero.

## 3. When it is used
PDF is used when:

- values are continuous  
- outcomes cannot be counted exactly  

Examples:

- height  
- time  
- revenue  
- temperature  

---

## 4. Key intuition
> PDF shows where uncertainty is concentrated, not exact probabilities.

Probability comes from **areas**, not points.
