# Simple Random Sampling (SRS)

## One-line idea
Simple random sampling selects units such that every possible sample of size n has an equal chance of being chosen.

---

## What it means

In simple random sampling:

- every unit has equal probability of selection  
- every combination of n units is equally likely  

Selection is purely random.

No structure. No grouping. No preference.

---

## Conceptual view
Population of size N  
↓  
Random selection of n units  
↓  
Sample


Equivalent to drawing names from a hat.

---

## Key properties

- unbiased in expectation  
- supports probability-based inference  
- sampling distribution is mathematically tractable  

This is the theoretical gold standard of sampling.

---

## Why it matters

Almost all statistical theory assumes:

- simple random sampling  
- independent observations  
- equal selection probability  

When these assumptions hold, inference formulas are valid.

---

## Example

Selecting 100 customers using:

- random number generator  
- lottery draw  
- shuffled ID list  

Each customer has the same chance of selection.

---

## Limitations

- requires complete sampling frame  
- impractical for large populations  
- expensive at scale  

Real-world surveys often approximate SRS.

---

## Important distinction

- **Random sampling** → general idea of randomness  
- **Simple random sampling** → exact formal implementation  

All SRS is random sampling,  
but not all random sampling is SRS.

---

## In short

> Simple random sampling is the cleanest form of randomness used in statistical inference.
