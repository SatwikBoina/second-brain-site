### 1️⃣ Definition

- It is a mapper to the real world outcomes of a [[Random Experiment]] with Real numbers.
- A real world outcome may or may not be numerical. Hence, we assign a number to the outcome which eases the math.
 **Note :** 
- It's a rule to map the outcome to Real Numbers.

###  2️⃣ Analogy / Intuition

**Coin Toss :**
- Real World Sample Space : ${H,T}$
- Random Variable $X$ : $$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Experiment: } & \text{Toss a fair coin} \\
\text{Sample Space: } & \Omega = \{H, T\} \\
\text{Random Variable: } & X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \\
& X(H) = 1 \\
& X(T) = 0 \\
& P(X=1) = \tfrac{1}{2} \\
& P(X=0) = \tfrac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

## One-line idea
A random variable is a function that converts random outcomes into numbers.

---

## Why it exists

Real-world outcomes are not numbers.

Examples:

- head / tail  
- customer buys / does not buy  
- rain / no rain  

Probability cannot work directly with these outcomes.

So we define a function that maps outcomes to numbers.

---

## Definition (conceptual)


Example:

- Head → 1  
- Tail → 0  

Now probability can be applied.

---

## Important insight

A random variable is **not random itself**.

The randomness comes from the outcome it depends on.

The function is fixed.

---

## Why this matters

Once outcomes are mapped to numbers, we can:

- assign probabilities  
- compute expectations  
- measure variance  
- build distributions  

Without random variables, probability theory cannot exist.

---

## Example

Let:

- X = number of purchases made by a customer in a day

X is a random variable because:

- the outcome varies
- the value is unknown before observation

---

## In short

> Random variables translate real-world uncertainty into mathematical form.
