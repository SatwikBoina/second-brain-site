## One-line idea
A confidence interval does not give the probability that the true parameter lies within a specific computed interval.

---

## The biggest misconception

❌ **Wrong interpretation:**

> “There is a 95% probability that the true mean lies in this interval.”

This statement is incorrect in frequentist statistics.

---

## Why it is wrong

In frequentist inference:

- the parameter is fixed  
- the data is random  

Once the interval is computed:

- it either contains the parameter  
- or it does not  

There is no probability left.

---

## What probability applies to

Probability applies to:

- the sampling process  
- the interval-generating procedure  

Not to the already-computed interval.

---

## Another common misunderstanding

❌ “95% of the data lies in the confidence interval.”

Also false.

A confidence interval is about:

- the population parameter  
- not individual observations  

---

## What a CI does NOT measure

A confidence interval does not measure:

- data spread  
- population variability  
- probability of the parameter  

It measures estimation uncertainty only.

---

## Why this confusion happens

Because human intuition is Bayesian.

But confidence intervals are frequentist objects.

---

## In short

> A confidence interval does not assign probability to the parameter — it assigns reliability to the procedure.
