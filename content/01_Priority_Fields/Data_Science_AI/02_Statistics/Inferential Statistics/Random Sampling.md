## One-line idea
Random sampling is the principle of selecting units using chance rather than human choice.

---

## What random sampling means

In random sampling:

- selection is governed by probability  
- human judgment is removed  
- inclusion chances are known or estimable  

Randomness applies to **selection**, not to data values.

---

## Why it is required

Random sampling ensures:

- representativeness in expectation  
- unbiased estimation  
- measurable uncertainty  

It allows probability theory to describe sampling behavior.

---

## What random sampling guarantees

Random sampling does **not** guarantee:

- perfect representativeness  
- absence of noise  
- identical samples  

It guarantees fairness over repeated sampling.

## Conceptual view

Population  
↓ chance-based selection  
Sample  
↓  
Valid probability inference


---

## Examples

- lottery-based selection  
- random number generators  
- shuffled ID lists  

Any method where chance alone governs inclusion.

---

## In short

> Random sampling is a principle, not a specific procedure.
