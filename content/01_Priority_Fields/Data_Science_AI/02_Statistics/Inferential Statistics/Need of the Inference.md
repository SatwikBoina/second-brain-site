# Why Inference Is Needed in Real-World Data

## One-line idea
Inference is needed because real-world data is limited, noisy, and uncertain.

---

## The ideal world

If we could observe:

- the entire population  
- perfectly measured values  
- no randomness  

then statistics would not be required.

We could compute the truth directly.

---

## The real world

In practice:

- we observe only samples  
- data contains randomness  
- measurements have error  
- outcomes vary naturally  

Complete certainty is impossible.

---

## Key limitations of real-world data

- **Limited data:** populations are too large or infinite  
- **Sampling variability:** different samples give different results  
- **Noise:** not all variation is meaningful  
- **Cost and time constraints:** full data collection is impractical

## What inference enables

Statistical inference allows us to:

- estimate unknown population values  
- quantify uncertainty  
- distinguish signal from randomness  
- make decisions with limited data  

---

## Without inference

We would:

- overtrust sample results  
- mistake noise for patterns  
- make unstable decisions  
- fail to generalize beyond observed data  

---

## Example

Two samples from the same population can give different averages.

Inference explains **why this happens** and **how confident we should be** in each result.

---

## In short

> Inference is necessary because data from the real world is incomplete and uncertain.
