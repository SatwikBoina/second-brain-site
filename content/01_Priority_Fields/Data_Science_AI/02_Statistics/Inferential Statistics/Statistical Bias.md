## One-line idea
Statistical bias occurs when a systematic error causes estimates to consistently differ from the true population value.

## Types of Statistical Bias

| Bias Type              | What It Means                                 | How It Occurs                   | Effect on Inference               |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| [[Sampling Bias]]  | Sample is not representative of population    | Non-random sampling             | Estimates shifted away from truth |
| [[Selection Bias]] | Certain units have higher chance of inclusion | Filtering before sampling       | Distorted population view         |
| **Non-response Bias**  | Some selected units do not respond            | Survey non-participation        | Missing systematic groups         |
| **Survivorship Bias**  | Only surviving units are observed             | Failures removed from data      | Overestimated performance         |
| **Measurement Bias**   | Data is recorded incorrectly                  | Faulty instruments or surveys   | Incorrect values                  |
| **Response Bias**      | Participants give inaccurate answers          | Social pressure or wording      | Misleading conclusions            |
| **Recall Bias**        | Participants misremember past events          | Memory limitations              | Inaccurate historical data        |
| **Observer Bias**      | Researcher influences results                 | Subjective judgment             | Directional distortion            |
| **Confirmation Bias**  | Analysis favors expected results              | Selective modeling or filtering | False validation                  |
| **Reporting Bias**     | Only certain results are published            | Suppressed negative outcomes    | Skewed evidence base              |
| **Attrition Bias**     | Participants drop out over time               | Longitudinal studies            | Non-random missing data           |
| **Undercoverage Bias** | Some population segments excluded             | Incomplete sampling frame       | Systematic exclusion              |

## Key property of bias

Bias is:

- systematic  
- directional  
- does not disappear with larger samples  

More data cannot fix bias.

## Core insight

> Variance decreases with data.  
> Bias does not.

---
Random error → averages out  
Bias → persists forever
