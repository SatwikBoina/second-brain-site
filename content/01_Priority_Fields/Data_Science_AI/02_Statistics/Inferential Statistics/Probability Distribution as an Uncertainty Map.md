## One-line idea
A probability distribution describes all possible values a random variable can take and how uncertain each value is.

---

## Why distributions exist

Before observing data:

- the value of a random variable is unknown  
- multiple outcomes are possible  

We need a way to represent this uncertainty **before observation**.

That representation is a probability distribution.

---

## Core idea

A probability distribution is not data.

It is a **map of uncertainty**.

It tells us:

- what values could occur  
- how likely each value is

## Conceptual view

## Example

Let:

- X = number of customers visiting a store tomorrow

Possible values:

- 0, 1, 2, 3, ...

The probability distribution assigns likelihoods to each value.

---

## Important insight

Two datasets may look similar,
but if their distributions differ:

- uncertainty differs  
- inference differs  

Inference depends on the distribution, not just observed values.

---

## Why inference depends on distributions

Distributions allow us to:

- compute expected values  
- measure variance  
- calculate probabilities of events  
- quantify uncertainty  

Inference is built entirely on distributions.

## In short
