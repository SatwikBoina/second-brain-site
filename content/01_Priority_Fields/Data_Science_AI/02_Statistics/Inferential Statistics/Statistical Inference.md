## One-line idea
Statistical inference is the process of using sample data to draw conclusions about a population.

---

## Why it exists

- We cannot observe the entire population.
- We only have access to samples.
- Samples contain randomness and noise.

Inference helps us reason beyond the observed data.

---

## What we want vs what we have

- **Population** → true but unknown  
- **Sample** → observed but imperfect  

Inference connects the two.

---

## What inference does

It allows us to:

- estimate unknown population values  
- measure uncertainty in estimates  
- make probability-based conclusions  

---

## Important note

Inference does not give exact truth.

It provides **estimates with uncertainty**, not certainty.

---

## In short

> Statistical inference is reasoning about the unknown using incomplete data and probability.
