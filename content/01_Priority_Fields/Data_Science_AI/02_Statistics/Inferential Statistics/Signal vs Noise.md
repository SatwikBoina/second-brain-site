## One-line idea
Signal is the meaningful pattern in data, while noise is random variation that does not carry information.

---

## Signal

- Represents true structure or relationship
- Comes from the underlying data generating process
- Stable across repeated samples

Examples:

- Effect of price on demand  
- Impact of promotion on sales  
- Relationship between study time and marks  

Signal is what we want to learn.

---

## Noise

- Random fluctuation in data
- Comes from randomness and measurement error
- Changes from sample to sample

Examples:

- Daily sales volatility  
- Random customer behavior  
- Data recording errors  

Noise is unavoidable.

## Conceptual view

---

## Key difference

| Signal | Noise |
|------|------|
| Meaningful | Random |
| Systematic | Irregular |
| Repeatable | Unpredictable |

---

## Why separation is hard

Signal and noise are mixed together.

We never observe them separately — only their sum.

---

## Role of statistics

Statistical methods help us:

- extract signal  
- reduce noise  
- avoid overfitting  
- generalize beyond the sample  

---

## Connection to inference

Inference attempts to:

- detect real signal  
- while accounting for noise  
- and quantifying uncertainty  

---

## In short

> Statistics exists to find signal in the presence of noise.
