# Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)

## 1. What it represents
The CDF gives the total probability accumulated up to a value.

It shows how probability builds as values increase.

---

## 2. How probability is defined
The CDF answers:

$P(X \leq x)$


It ranges from 0 to 1.

---

## 3. When it is used
CDF is used when:

- computing probabilities  
- finding percentiles  
- calculating p-values  
- building confidence intervals  

---

## 4. Key intuition
> The CDF is the running total of uncertainty.

Almost all inferential calculations rely on the CDF.
