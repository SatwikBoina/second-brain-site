## One-line idea
A data generating process is the underlying mechanism that produces the data we observe.

---

## Core idea

Data does not appear randomly on its own.

Every dataset is created by:

- real-world mechanisms  
- human behavior  
- business rules  
- natural randomness  

Together, these form the **data generating process**.

## Conceptual view
![[DGP.png]]

We only see the final output — not the full process.

---

## What a DGP includes

A data generating process consists of:

- population distribution  
- relationships between variables  
- randomness  
- measurement error  

All data is a realization from this process.

---

## Important insight

The dataset you observe is:

- one possible outcome  
- from many possible samples  
- generated by the same DGP  

Another sample would look different.

---

## Why DGP matters

Understanding the DGP helps us:

- choose appropriate models  
- avoid incorrect assumptions  
- explain variability in data  
- generalize beyond the sample  

---

## Link to inference

Inference attempts to learn:

- properties of the DGP  
- using limited observed data  

We never observe the DGP directly — we infer it.

---

## In short

> Data is not truth itself; it is a sample produced by an underlying process.
