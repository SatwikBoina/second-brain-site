## One-line idea
The sampling distribution of the mean describes how sample means vary across repeated samples from the same population.

---

## What it is

Instead of looking at individual data values, we:

- repeatedly draw samples of size n  
- compute the mean of each sample  

The distribution of these means is the sampling distribution.

## Conceptual view

Population  
↓ sample  
Sample 1 → mean₁  
Sample 2 → mean₂  
Sample 3 → mean₃  
↓
Sampling distribution of the mean

---

## What it describes

It captures:

- variability of the sample mean  
- uncertainty in estimating the population mean  

Each point represents **one sample mean**.

---

## Key properties

- Center = population mean (μ)  
- Spread = standard error (σ / √n)  
- Shape → approximately normal (CLT)  

---

## Why it matters

All inference about means is based on:

- this distribution  
- not raw data  

Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests operate here.

---

## Important clarification

The sampling distribution is:

- not the population distribution  
- not the sample distribution  

It is a distribution of statistics.

---

## In short

> Inference about means happens on the sampling distribution, not on the data itself.
