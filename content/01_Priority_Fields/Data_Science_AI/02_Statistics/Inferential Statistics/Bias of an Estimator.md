# Bias of an Estimator

## One-line idea
The bias of an estimator measures how far its expected value is from the true population parameter.

---

## Why bias matters

An estimator can be:

- consistently too high  
- consistently too low  

Even with large samples.

Bias captures this systematic error.

---

## Conceptual definition

An estimator is **unbiased** if:
Expected value of estimator = true parameter

Otherwise, it is biased.

---

## Interpretation

- Zero bias → correct on average  
- Positive bias → overestimates  
- Negative bias → underestimates  

Bias describes long-run behavior, not a single sample.

---

## Example

If repeated samples produce estimates centered above the true value:

→ estimator has positive bias.

If centered below:

→ negative bias.

---

## Important insight

Bias does not disappear by averaging more data from the same estimator.

It is built into the estimation rule.

---

## Why bias matters in inference

Biased estimators lead to:

- shifted confidence intervals  
- misleading conclusions  
- incorrect parameter learning  

Even with infinite data.

---

## In short

> Bias measures systematic deviation from the truth.
