## One-line idea
A deterministic system gives the same output every time, while a stochastic system includes randomness.

---

## Deterministic system

- No randomness  
- Same input → same output  
- Fully predictable  

Examples:

- \( y = 2x + 3 \)  
- Calculator operations  
- Ideal physics equations  

Repeating the process gives identical results.

---

## Stochastic system

- Randomness is present  
- Same input → different outputs  
- Only probabilistic predictions are possible  

Examples:

- Customer demand  
- Website clicks  
- Stock prices  
- Human behavior  

Repeating the process gives different outcomes.

## Key difference

| Deterministic | Stochastic |
|--------------|------------|
| No randomness | Randomness present |
| Predictable | Uncertain |
| Fixed outcome | Distribution of outcomes |

## Why statistics focuses on stochastic systems

Real-world data is:

- noisy  
- variable  
- uncertain  

Randomness cannot be removed — only modeled.

---

## Connection to inference

Because systems are stochastic:

- population truth cannot be observed directly  
- samples vary  
- estimates contain uncertainty  

This is why statistical inference exists.

---

## In short

> Statistics is needed because the real world is stochastic, not deterministic.
