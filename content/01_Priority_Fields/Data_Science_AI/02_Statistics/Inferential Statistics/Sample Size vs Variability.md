## One-line idea
Increasing sample size reduces estimation uncertainty, but does not reduce the inherent variability in the data.

---

## Two sources of variation

Data variation comes from:

1. **Population variability**  
2. **Sampling variability**

These are not the same.

---

## Population variability

- Natural spread in the population  
- Does not change with more data  

Example:

- income variation  
- height variation  

More samples do not make people more similar.

---

## Sampling variability

- Variation in statistics across samples  
- Decreases as sample size increases  

This is what standard error measures.

---

## Conceptual view
Population variability → fixed  
Sampling variability → decreases with n

---

## Role of sample size

As sample size increases:

- estimates become more stable  
- standard error decreases  
- confidence intervals narrow  

But population variance remains unchanged.

---

## Diminishing returns

Uncertainty decreases with:

$$
\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

This means:

- 4× data → 2× precision  
- 100× data → 10× precision  

Large gains require massive data growth.

---

## Important insight

Big data cannot fix:

- bias  
- poor sampling  
- dependence  
- wrong models  

Only random variability reduces with size.

---

## In short

> Sample size reduces uncertainty, not variability in the population.

---
More data → less sampling noise
More data ≠ less population spread
