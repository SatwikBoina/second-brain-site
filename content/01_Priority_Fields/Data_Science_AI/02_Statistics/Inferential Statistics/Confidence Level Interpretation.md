## One-line idea
The confidence level is the long-run proportion of confidence intervals that will contain the true parameter.

---

## What “95% confidence” means

If we:

- repeatedly draw samples  
- compute a confidence interval each time  

Then:

95% of those intervals will contain the true parameter


---

## What it does NOT mean

It does NOT mean:

- there is a 95% probability the parameter lies in this interval  
- 95% of data lies inside the interval  

Both are incorrect.

---

## Conceptual visualization


Some intervals miss. Most capture.

---

## Why confidence level matters

Higher confidence level:

- increases chance of coverage  
- produces wider intervals  

Lower confidence level:

- narrower intervals  
- higher risk of missing the parameter  

---

## Common confidence levels

- 90%  
- 95%  
- 99%  

These reflect different trade-offs between precision and certainty.

---

## Important insight

Confidence level is a property of the **method**, not of the result.

---

## In short

> “95% confidence” means the method succeeds 95% of the time in the long run.
