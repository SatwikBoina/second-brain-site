The primary difference between the population & sample must be better known before diving into the realm of the statistics.
### Key Points :
1. Population is the ultimate truth we are seeking for.
2. It is practically infeasible to go after each data point in a population to make inference about.
3. **Generalisation :** We try to focus our observations on the samples and from there we jump to infer more about the population.
