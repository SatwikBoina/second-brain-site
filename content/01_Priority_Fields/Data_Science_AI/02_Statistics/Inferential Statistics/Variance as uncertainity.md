## One-line idea
Variance measures how far random outcomes typically spread from the expected value.

---

## Why variance exists

Two random processes can have:

- the same expected value  
- very different behavior  

Expected value alone cannot describe uncertainty.

Variance exists to measure that uncertainty.

---

## What variance represents

Variance quantifies:

- how dispersed outcomes are  
- how unstable the process is  
- how uncertain predictions will be  

Higher variance → more uncertainty  
Lower variance → more stability

---

## Conceptual view

![[variance as uncertainity.png]]
It measures how much randomness deviates from expectation.

---

## Example

Process A:
- outcomes tightly clustered near the mean

Process B:
- outcomes widely spread

Both may have the same expected value,
but Process B is far more uncertain.

## Why variance matters in inference

Variance determines:

- reliability of estimates  
- width of confidence intervals  
- size of standard error  
- statistical significance  

Inference is impossible without measuring variance.

---

## Important insight

Variance is not noise itself.

It is the **amount of uncertainty caused by noise**.

---

## In short

> Expected value tells us where outcomes center.  
> Variance tells us how uncertain that center is.
