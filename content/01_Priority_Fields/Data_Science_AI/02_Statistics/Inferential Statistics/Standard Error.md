# Standard Error

## One-line idea
Standard error measures how much a statistic varies from sample to sample.

---

## Why standard error exists

A statistic computed from one sample is not fixed.

If we draw another sample:

- the value changes  
- even from the same population  

Standard error quantifies this variation.

---

## What it represents

Standard error is:

- the standard deviation of the sampling distribution  
- the uncertainty of an estimator  

It tells us how precise an estimate is.

---

## Conceptual view


---

## Important distinction

- **Standard deviation** → variability of data  
- **Standard error** → variability of the estimator  

They are not the same.

---

## Key intuition

- Large standard error → unstable estimate  
- Small standard error → precise estimate  

More data reduces standard error.

---

## Why it matters in inference

Standard error determines:

- width of confidence intervals  
- size of test statistics  
- statistical significance  
- reliability of conclusions  

Inference is built directly on standard error.

---

## In short

> Standard error measures uncertainty in our estimate, not in the data itself.
