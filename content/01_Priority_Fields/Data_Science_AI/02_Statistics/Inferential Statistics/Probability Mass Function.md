## 1. What it represents
The PMF assigns probability directly to each possible value of a discrete random variable.

Each outcome has its own probability mass.

---

## 2. How probability is defined
Probability is defined at exact values:
$P(X = x)$

The probabilities across all values sum to 1.

---

## 3. When it is used
PMF is used when:

- outcomes are countable  
- values are discrete  

Examples:

- number of customers  
- dice outcomes  
- defect counts  

---

## 4. Key intuition
> PMF answers: “How much probability belongs to each exact value?”

Probability sits **on points**, not between them.
