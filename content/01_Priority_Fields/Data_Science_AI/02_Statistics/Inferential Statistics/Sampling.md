## One-line idea
We sample because observing the entire population is usually impossible.Sampling methods define *how observations are selected from a population*, which directly affects bias, variance, and validity of inference.


---

## The ideal situation

If we could observe:

- every customer  
- every transaction  
- every voter  

then inference would not be needed.

We could compute population values directly.

---

## Reality

In practice:

- populations are extremely large  
- data collection is expensive  
- time is limited  
- some populations are infinite  

Full population measurement is unrealistic.

---

## What sampling allows

Sampling allows us to:

- estimate population parameters  
- measure uncertainty  
- make decisions with limited data  

---

## Key trade-off

- Population → Truth  
- Sample → Approximation + Uncertainty

Sampling trades certainty for feasibility.

---

## Core insight

> Statistics exists because populations cannot be fully observed.

# Types of Sampling — Overview Table

| Category | Sampling Type | Core Idea | When Used | Inference Valid |
|--------|----------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Probability Sampling** | Simple Random Sampling | Every unit has equal chance of selection | Small, well-defined populations | ✅ Yes |
|  | Systematic Sampling | Select every k-th unit after random start | Ordered lists | ✅ Yes* |
|  | Stratified Sampling | Population split into strata; sample within each | Heterogeneous populations | ✅ Yes |
|  | Cluster Sampling | Randomly sample entire clusters | Large geographic populations | ✅ Yes |
|  | Multistage Sampling | Sampling done in stages | National surveys | ✅ Yes |
| **Non-Probability Sampling** | Convenience Sampling | Select easiest available units | Quick analysis | ❌ No |
|  | Judgment / Purposive Sampling | Expert-selected samples | Case studies | ❌ No |
|  | Quota Sampling | Match population proportions manually | Market research | ❌ No |
|  | Snowball Sampling | Participants recruit others | Hidden populations | ❌ No |

## Important note

\* Systematic sampling can introduce bias if hidden periodic patterns exist.

## Core insight

> Only probability sampling supports statistical inference.
