### 1️⃣ Definition
- It is an act which yields the outcome(s).
- **Characteristics :**
	- It can be repeatable under ideal conditions
	- [[Sample Space]] : We know the outcomes before-hand

###  2️⃣ Analogy / Intuition

Vending Machine : 
- The act of putting a coin inside is going to get us a soda can.

### 3️⃣ Classification :

- [[Random Experiment]] :
	- The outcome can take any value in the sample space for a specific experiment.
	- There is no reproducibility.
- Deterministic Experiment :
	- The outcomes are predictable based on the actions
	- There are pre-defined rules
