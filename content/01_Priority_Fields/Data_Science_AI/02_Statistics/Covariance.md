### 1️⃣ Definition
It states the relationship between two features in what direction they are most likely to impact each other rather than by how much.
- It assumes there is a *linear relationship* between two features. It fails to capture complex relationships.
- The comparison has to be done for the same entity only.
- It's a unit-less quantity which never emphasizes the strength of the variation but only the direction.
