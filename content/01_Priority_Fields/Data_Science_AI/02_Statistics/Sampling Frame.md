## Definiton :
The mechanism which is used to reach the population is called a Sampling Frame.
- It is the accessible version of the theoretical or unreachable population.
- **The Frame defines the limit of your model's intelligence.** A model cannot learn patterns from data that never had a chance to enter the frame.

### Characteristics of an Ideal Sampling Frame :
1. **Completeness:** Every member of the Target Population is on the list.
2. **Accuracy:** The information on the list is correct (e.g., active email addresses, not dead ones).
3. **No Duplication:** Each member appears only once. (If I appear twice in your database, I have double the chance of being picked, which biases the sample).
