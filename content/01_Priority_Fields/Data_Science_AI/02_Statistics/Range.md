###  2️⃣ Analogy / Intuition

**Rohit Sharma's ODI Scores :**
![[Rohit Range.png]]

Examples:
- Rohit can score anywhere between 0 and 264. But, He often scores more within $[0,100]$. Range sheds light on his potential but not on his actual performance.

### 3️⃣ Formula
$$
Range = X_{max}-X_{min}
$$

**Note :**
- Depends on the extreme values
- If the sample size increases, It increases the chances of catching the rare extremes in a population. Hence, Range is biased towards the sample.
