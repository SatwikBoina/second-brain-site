## Usage Rules

- Do NOT add explanations here  
- Do NOT add formulas here  
- Only link to MOCs or atomic notes  
- Extract a new MOC if a section becomes dense

---

## Growth Philosophy

This MOC grows by:
- Adding links, not paragraphs
- Letting backlinks define importance
- Keeping concepts atomic and reusable
