|---|---|---|
|**Identity**|The **Atom of Meaning**.|The **Family Name**.|
|**Definition**|The smallest possible unit that carries meaning or grammatical function.|The abstract, "dictionary-form" of a word that covers all its variations.|
|**Size**|Can be a whole word, a prefix, or a suffix.|Usually a whole word (the "root").|
|**NLP Process**|Relates to **Tokenization** (breaking things down).|Relates to **Lemmatization** (grouping things up).|
|**Example 1**|In **"Unbreakable"**: `un`, `break`, `able` (3 morphemes).|In **"Unbreakable"**: The lexeme is `BREAK`.|
|**Example 2**|In **"Cats"**: `cat` (meaning) + `s` (plurality).|In **"Cat, Cats, Cat's"**: The lexeme is `CAT`.|
|**Goal**|To understand the **building blocks** of a word.|To understand the **base concept** behind a word.|
|**Focus**|Internal structure of words.|Relationships between different forms of words.|
## Understanding :
- **Morphemes:** `Dance` (the action) + `ed` (the past time). You have **two** physical chunks of meaning.
- **Lexeme:** The lexeme is **DANCE**. It doesn't matter if the word is _dancing, danced, or dances_—the "Lexeme" (the concept) remains the same.
