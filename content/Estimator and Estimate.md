# What Is an Estimator?

## One-line idea
An estimator is a rule or function that uses sample data to estimate an unknown population parameter.

---

## What we want vs what we observe

- Population parameters → fixed but unknown  
- Sample data → observed but random  

An estimator connects the two.

## Definition (conceptual)
Estimator:  
Sample data → estimate of parameter

It is a function of random variables.

---

## Important distinction

- **Estimator** → random variable  
- **Estimate** → realized numerical value  

Example:

- x̄ → estimator  
- 102.4 → estimate  

---

## Why estimators are random

Different samples produce:

- different values  
- different estimates  

Therefore estimators have:

- distributions  
- variance  
- bias  

---

## Role in inference

Estimators are used to:

- estimate parameters  
- build confidence intervals  
- perform hypothesis tests  

All inference begins with an estimator.

## In short

> An estimator is a random rule for guessing an unknown population truth.
