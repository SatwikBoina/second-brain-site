title: Satwik’s Second Brain
---

# 👋 Hi, I’m Satwik

I’m a **Data Analyst / Data Scientist in the making**, building this space as my  
**personal second brain** — a place where I think clearly, connect ideas, and prepare myself for high-impact work and interviews.

This is **not a blog** and **not a portfolio**.  
It’s where I turn *confusion into clarity*.

---

## 🎯 What I’m Actively Focusing On
*(These are my core priority areas — everything else supports them)*

- 🧠 [[📌 MOC — Machine Learning]]
- 📊 [[Neural Networks — MOC]]

> If I master these four, everything else compounds.

---

## 🧭 How This Brain Is Structured

- **MOCs (Maps of Content)** → high-level understanding  
- **Concept notes** → intuition + examples  
- **Interview notes** → crisp explanations, traps, and stories  
- **Links > folders** → thinking in networks, not silos  

I revise this system **continuously**, not perfectly.

## 🧑‍💻 About Me (Context)

- 🎓 Background: Data Analysis / Analytics
- 🏭 Domains of interest: **FMCG, Business Analytics, ML systems**
- 🎯 Career goal:  
  To become a **strong, intuitive data scientist** who understands both  
  *models* **and** *business impact*.

I believe:
- Understanding beats memorization  
- Intuition beats formula dumping  
- Consistency beats intensity

## 🔗 Find Me Elsewhere

- 💼 **LinkedIn**: *https://www.linkedin.com/in/satwik-boina-5a37a418b/*
- ✍️ This site is my **thinking log**, not my highlight reel

---

## ⚡ How I Use This Site (My Rules)

- If I can’t explain it simply → I don’t understand it
- Every topic must answer **“why does this matter?”**
- Confusing topics are tagged `#confusing`, not avoided
- Interview prep is **integrated**, not last-minute

---

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision

This second brain is meant to:
- Make me **interview-ready without panic**
- Help me **teach and explain clearly**
- Scale with my career over years, not months

> *This is a living system.  
> Growth > perfection.*
