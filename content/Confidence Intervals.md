# What a Confidence Interval Really Is

## One-line idea
A confidence interval is a range of values produced by a random sampling procedure that captures the true parameter with a known long-run frequency.

---

## Core idea

A confidence interval is not about a single dataset.

It is about **a procedure applied repeatedly**.

---

## Conceptual view
Sample → interval  
Sample → interval  
Sample → interval

Some intervals contain the true parameter.
Some do not.

---

## What is random

- the sample is random  
- the interval is random  

The parameter is fixed.

---

## Long-run meaning

If we repeatedly:

- draw samples  
- compute confidence intervals  

Then:
95 % of those intervals will contain the true parameter.


---

## What the interval represents

The confidence interval reflects:

- sampling uncertainty  
- variability of the estimator  

It is derived from the sampling distribution.

---

## Why confidence intervals exist

Point estimates give no uncertainty.

Confidence intervals quantify:

- estimation error  
- reliability of the estimate  

---

## In short

> A confidence interval is a random interval generated by a procedure with guaranteed long-run coverage.
